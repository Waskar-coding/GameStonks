Once you have started your participation you will be assigned a score which is a
measure of your probability of recieving a prize, note that you will not be told 
the score you gain with every action from beforehand, but you can use your intuition 
to maximize your score using the following insights.

- Not all games are worth the same score:
	This is quite arbitrary and will depend on how much we currently
	value this game's information. We might hint at how important is
	a game or a group of games in our blog in the site's frontpage.

- Most of the listed games are recent releases:
	This means that these are games you should just have started playing, or
	maybe you were thinking about buying them. You should declare your ownership
	as soon as possible, otherwise we will be loosing valuable information about
	your first days of gameplay.

- If the game is not popular it might be worth more than you think:
	A game's score is not necesarily linked ot its success or its price. Generally
	if we do not have much data about a game we will award more score in exchange of 
	information.

- Don't overdo it:
	If we get our data always from the same sources its value might decrease.
	This does not mean you cannot parcipipate in multiple jackpots or declare you
	own more than a game, but take into account that after a certain number of
	yearly declarations you might not gain as much as you used to. This penalization
	goes away by taking a break from declaring your ownership for one or two months,
	if you wish to keep on participating you can always get referenced by friends 
	or try to compensate the debuff by using multipliers.  

- The more friends you invite the higher your score will be.

- You can use multipliers won in events to elevate your score:
	However every Jackpot has a limit of multipliers.
