You shall be kicked from the jackpot and issued a strike if you
do

- Declaring you own a game that you don't actually own.

- Declaring you own a game while having a private profile.

- Setting your profile to private any time during the jackpot:
	This rule extends beyong the jackpot, remember that by 
	declaring your ownership you allow this site to recopilate data
	for as long as necessary (also remember you will be notified when
	we have stopped registering data about a game). If you set
	your visibily status to private (or Friends Only) after the
	Jackpot has ended we cannot kick you, but you will be issued as strike.

- Dropping a game:
	In GameStonks we think you are in your right to demand all
	your related information and make us delete most of it if you
	deem it necessary. That is why we give you the right to drop
	all the gameplay information we have about your gameplay. In
	this jackpot we give you a drop option which will allow you to
	delete all the information this website has been gathering
	about you during this jackpot. If you want to delete other
	information you will have to contact us personally. This however
	comes with consequences, because it wastes our time and resources,
	and therefore you will be kicked from the current jackpot and
	issued a strike
