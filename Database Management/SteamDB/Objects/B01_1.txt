We have blacklisted your profile because it has been deemed not valid for this website.

This can be caused by three reasons:

- The privacy state of your profile is not public: 
	We understand if you want to keep your account in a Private state, but if this is
	the first time you sign in through Steam on this site we need to make sure for security
	reasons that your profile is legit. In order to unban yourself you have to change your
	profile privacy state to Public, at least the when you sign in for the first time.
	You can follow this link if you wish to learn how to do it:
		https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4113-YUDH-6401
	If you wish to return to the Private state once you are logged in, be aware that most of 
	our Jackpots and Events require a Public profile and that you might be issued a strike for
	breaking their rules, so consider changing temporally your privacy state every time you
	participate. 

- Your account is too recent:
	GameStonks rewards you for bringing new users to participate into our Jackpots,
	for this reasons we have to avoid very recent acccount that could be created to
	manipulate the odds of being awarded. To enter GameStonks your account must be AT
	LEAST A YEAR OLD. You can check when your account was created here if you search
	it (using your profile's url) here:

- Your account is not valuable enough:
	We measure the current value of your account as another security measure to avoid
	false accounts. You can see your account current value here:
